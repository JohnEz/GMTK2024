  introduction: 'Oh hi! Welcome to Train Set GO!

    I''m Lenny the Locomotive.
    Let''s build a cool railway together!

    Click an arrow to get started.'
  buildTutorial: OK great, now click one of the line pieces at the bottom of the
    screen to place it. We need to connect these stations together to make a route.
  scaleUpTutorial: 'Very cool! Placing tracks costs money though, and we''re running
    low. Whenever I run out of money, I just talk to my mate Terry. Click the Scale
    Up button to visit him. '
  lineTutorial: 'They''re gone! All gone! The ENTIRE NETWORK has disappeared!

    Wait,
    who are you? We need to fix this before the stations become overcrowded!

    Click
    on a route to create a line.'
  returnToKidTutorial: 'Phew! That''s better. My name is Terrence the Train, by the
    way, not Terry.

    We still have work to do: can you see that new station?
    We need to connect it to the network. Maybe Lenny can help?'
  connectStationTutorial: Whoa! We wiped out Terry's precious tracks with a "Built
    to Scale" model of our toy line? I guess we could help by connecting the new
    station with a cool track?
  returnToAdultTutorial: 'Nice route!

    Now Terry will be fretting about adding
    this new route to a line. You''d better go back to the real model.'
  secondLineTutorial: You're back! I don't know what you did, but we need to make
    a new line. Click the new route to assign it to a line.
  changeLineTutorial: To switch lines, just click on the route again. We need to
    make sure this network is built to scale up to hundreds of passengers, so careful
    line management is key.
  coolPointsTutorial: Careful line managment? Boring! What we care about is making
    cool tracks! You'll get more cool points by building near to obstacles.
  moneyTutorial: 'Terry gives me a percentage of passenger fees as pocket money,
    but if his stations get too crowded I bet he''ll stop doing that.

    I guess
    we can help him out too..'
  addTrainsTutorial: A well-oiled railway requires high capacity. We can add new
    trains to lines to increase the number of passengers we can carry. We can't afford
    one just yet though.
