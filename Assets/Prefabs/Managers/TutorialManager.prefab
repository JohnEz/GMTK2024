  introduction: 'Oh hi! Welcome to Train Set GO!

    I''m Lenny the Locomotive.
    Let''s build a cool railway together!

    Click an arrow to get started.'
  buildTutorial: OK great, now click one of the line pieces at the bottom of the
    screen to place it. We need to connect these stations together to make a route.
  scaleUpTutorial: "Very cool! Placing tracks costs \xA3 though, and we're running
    low. Whenever I run out of money, I just talk to my mate Terry. Click the Scale
    Up button to visit him. "
  lineTutorial: 'They''re gone! All gone! All my train tracks have disappeared!

    Wait,
    who are you? We need to fix this before the stations becoem overcrowded.

    Click
    on a route to create a line.'
  returnToKidTutorial: 'Phew! I''m Terrence the Train, by the way.

    We still
    have work to do: can you see that new station? We need to connect it to the network.
    Can you help?'
  coolPointsTutorial: Whoa! We wiped out Terry's precious tracks with a "Built to
    Scale" model of our toy line? I guess we could give him a hand, by connecting
    the new station with a cool track.
